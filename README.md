# Virtual Pet 2 Project

This project allows us to practice pair programming, Test Driven Development, and Java fundamentals.

Virtual pet allows the user to create their own virtual pet, name it and give it a description.

The user has 3 actions they can take with their pet, fee, water, and play.  These actions affect the status of their pet.
